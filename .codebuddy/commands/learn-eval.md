# /learn-eval - Extract, Evaluate, then Save

Extends `/learn` with a quality gate and save-location decision before writing any skill file.

## What to Extract

Look for:

1. **Error Resolution Patterns** â€?root cause + fix + reusability
2. **Debugging Techniques** â€?non-obvious steps, tool combinations
3. **Workarounds** â€?library quirks, API limitations, version-specific fixes
4. **Project-Specific Patterns** â€?conventions, architecture decisions, integration patterns

## Process

1. Review the session for extractable patterns
2. Identify the most valuable/reusable insight

3. **Determine save location:**
   - Ask: "Would this pattern be useful in a different project?"
   - **Global** (`~/.codebuddy/skills/learned/`): Generic patterns usable across 2+ projects (bash compatibility, LLM API behavior, debugging techniques, etc.)
   - **Project** (`.codebuddy/skills/learned/` in current project): Project-specific knowledge (quirks of a particular config file, project-specific architecture decisions, etc.)
   - When in doubt, choose Global (moving Global â†?Project is easier than the reverse)

4. Draft the skill file using this format:

```markdown
---
name: pattern-name
description: "Under 130 characters"
user-invocable: false
origin: auto-extracted
---

# [Descriptive Pattern Name]

**Extracted:** [Date]
**Context:** [Brief description of when this applies]

## Problem
[What problem this solves - be specific]

## Solution
[The pattern/technique/workaround - with code examples]

## When to Use
[Trigger conditions]
```

5. **Self-evaluate before saving** using this rubric:

   | Dimension | 1 | 3 | 5 |
   |-----------|---|---|---|
   | Specificity | Abstract principles only, no code examples | Representative code example present | Rich examples covering all usage patterns |
   | Actionability | Unclear what to do | Main steps are understandable | Immediately actionable, edge cases covered |
   | Scope Fit | Too broad or too narrow | Mostly appropriate, some boundary ambiguity | Name, trigger, and content perfectly aligned |
   | Non-redundancy | Nearly identical to another skill | Some overlap but unique perspective exists | Completely unique value |
   | Coverage | Covers only a fraction of the target task | Main cases covered, common variants missing | Main cases, edge cases, and pitfalls covered |

   - Score each dimension 1â€?
   - If any dimension scores 1â€?, improve the draft and re-score until all dimensions are â‰?3
   - Show the user the scores table and the final draft

6. Ask user to confirm:
   - Show: proposed save path + scores table + final draft
   - Wait for explicit confirmation before writing

7. Save to the determined location

## Output Format for Step 5 (scores table)

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Specificity | N/5 | ... |
| Actionability | N/5 | ... |
| Scope Fit | N/5 | ... |
| Non-redundancy | N/5 | ... |
| Coverage | N/5 | ... |
| **Total** | **N/25** | |

## Notes

- Don't extract trivial fixes (typos, simple syntax errors)
- Don't extract one-time issues (specific API outages, etc.)
- Focus on patterns that will save time in future sessions
- Keep skills focused â€?one pattern per skill
- If Coverage score is low, add related variants before saving
